# RMD Datasets

A dataset proposed in "Fusion Transformer-Based Salient Object Detection in Multispectral Polarimetric Imagery"

## Dataset Description

This is a dataset for salient object detection in polarized images, containing 15 sets of images, each consisting of four polarized images and one Ground Truth. The original polarization images are derived from a public dataset [1].
